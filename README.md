# Jenkins on Wheels

Jenkins on Wheels aims to provide a production-grade, fully managed Jenkins platform built for modern enterprises. The project bundles Jenkins running on Linux with Kubernetes, Helm, and an operational model that prioritizes maintainability, high availability, reliability, and safe plugin management — so you can offer it as a complete CI/CD service to companies.

## Project Goals

- Provide a fully automated Jenkins deployment that runs on Linux and Kubernetes.
- Eliminate common maintenance burdens by delivering automatic, safe updates.
- Ensure availability and resilience through Kubernetes-native patterns (HA, self-healing, rolling upgrades).
- Prevent and recover from plugin-related crashes with automatic rollback mechanisms.
- Deliver a product companies can purchase as a managed Jenkins service (SLA, monitoring, and operational practices included).

## Key Features

- Kubernetes-native Jenkins: Jenkins master agents deployed on Kubernetes for resilience and scale.
- Helm charts: Manageable, reusable Helm charts to install and upgrade Jenkins and its components.
- Automatic maintenance & updates: Automated and auditable update flows for Jenkins core and curated plugin sets.
- Safe plugin lifecycle: Staged plugin installs with automated verification and rollback on failure.
- High availability: Multi-replica controllers, persistent volumes with proper failover, and readiness/liveness checks.
- Observability & monitoring: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, logs centralized for incident response.
- Security & Linux-first: All components run on Linux hosts with best-practice container hardening, RBAC, and network policies.

## Why this solves companies' Jenkins problems

- Maintenance: The platform is designed for automated updates — Jenkins core, plugin bundles, and Helm charts are versioned and rolled out through controlled pipelines that minimize manual maintenance.
- Availability & Resilience: Kubernetes provides pod restarts, node failover, and horizontal scaling. Combined with proper storage and service design, this reduces downtime and improves recovery time objectives.
- Reliability: By codifying configuration in Helm charts and GitOps-friendly manifests, changes are reproducible and auditable. Health probes and proactive alerts reduce mean time to detection.
- Plugin crashes: Plugin incompatibilities and bad installs cause a large portion of Jenkins incidents. This project implements staged plugin installation flows with smoke tests and automatic rollbacks to the last-known-good state if failures are detected.

## High-level architecture

1. Helm-managed Jenkins master deployment (stateful) with:
   - Multiple replicas where appropriate
   - Persistent storage for job configs and build history
   - Liveness/readiness probes
2. Kubernetes agents (ephemeral) to run jobs and scale horizontally.
3. A controlled update pipeline for Jenkins core and plugins:
   - Build/test stage for plugin compatibility
   - Canary or staged rollout via Helm
   - Automated rollback when smoke tests or health checks fail
4. Observability stack: Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, and centralized logging (e.g., EFK/PLG).
5. Optional integrations: SSO (OIDC/SAML), secrets backends (HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets), and artifact registries.

## How it works (contract)

- Inputs: Jenkins job definitions, plugin list/manifest, Helm values (configuration), and cluster credentials.
- Outputs: A running, monitored Jenkins service that executes CI/CD pipelines reliably and produces job logs, artifacts, and metrics.
- Error modes & recovery: If a plugin/core update causes instability, the platform runs verification tests and rolls back the deployment automatically to the previous stable release; operators are alerted.
- Success criteria: Automated updates applied with <defined canary window>, zero-downtime or acceptable rolling restarts, and successful automated rollback when verification fails.

## Roadmap & Future features

This README intentionally keeps space for future additions. Potential next-steps and enhancements:

- Multi-tenancy: Logical separation for teams with quotas and resource isolation.
- Fine-grained RBAC and policy enforcement across jobs and views.
- Automatic dependency scanning and security vulnerability alerts for plugins.
- Plugin compatibility analytics: track which plugins and versions are safe across many installs.
- Backup & restore: managed backups of Jenkins state and configuration with point-in-time recovery.
- Cost optimization: autoscaling policies and spot-instance-friendly agents.
- A SaaS offering wrapper: onboarding, SLA tiers, billing, and usage dashboards.

## For prospective customers (sales-friendly summary)

Jenkins on Wheels is built to let you adopt Jenkins without inheriting its operational headaches. We provide a Linux-first, Kubernetes-hosted Jenkins that updates itself safely, recovers from failures, and includes mechanisms to prevent plugin-related downtime. This reduces TCO, minimizes engineer time on maintenance, and provides the reliability businesses expect from a managed CI/CD service.

Contact: This repository is the technical foundation — when packaged with onboarding, SLAs, and managed support it becomes a turnkey Jenkins service for companies.

## Contribution & Support

- Contributions are welcome. Open an issue or PR with proposed changes.
- For production support & SLAs, maintain a commercial support channel (email/contract) — this README is for the repo and positioning; implementation and operational runbooks live in the docs folder (TODO).

Notes / TODOs:
- Add step-by-step deployment guides, Helm values examples, and an operational runbook.
- Add example scripts for automated plugin verification and rollback tests.
